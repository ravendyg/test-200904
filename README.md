Using ant.design UI library create a Form that will consist of 2 elements: country selector and phone number input. When user selects a country, a mask with country phone number format and country prefix should be added to phone number input. Phone number input should be disabled if country is not selected. All fields are required and should be validated properly. You can use any library for countries or phone format, but we would recommend https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n-iso-countries and https://www.npmjs.com/package/libphonenumber-js
