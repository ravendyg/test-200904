Create a button component on a simple white background. Using React Hooks and Context create a theme switcher button, to cycle through 3 themes. In Light theme, the button should be black and the background should be white, in the Dark theme the button should be white and the background should be black, and in Blue theme, the background should be light blue and the button should be grey. Button label should indicate the next theme, ex. "Switch to Light theme".
